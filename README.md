# innosoftfusiongo-schedule

Generate weekly schedules from Innosoft Fusion Go data.

- Optimizes the schedule to have the fewest number of individual times and exceptions/exclusions.
- Robust caching and error handling.
- Semantic HTML and modern CSS.
- Configurable activity filters.
- Customizable colors (using Material Design 3 dynamic color).

Also see [innosoftfusiongo-ical](https://github.com/pgaskin/innosoftfusiongo-ical) for generating iCalendar feeds.

See [arc.qu.pgaskin.net](https://arc.qu.pgaskin.net) for Queen's University ARC schedules.

I originally created this because the Queen's University ARC keeps changing/cancelling the lane swim times at the last minute, the official schedule doesn't show the updates, and the app only lets you see one day at a time (and I don't want to use it anyways).
